## What is it?

bevy codegen is a base library for generating bevy code and provide a serializable bevy format.
Use an API to create, save and load bevy code, ideally using a gui like [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) at some point or it could be integrated with [bevy_editor_pls](https://github.com/jakobhellermann/bevy_editor_pls).

## Usage

If you want to run the build and run commands you can 
do so by running `cargo run -- default default`

Otherwise call `cargo run -- --help` for help.
